#Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, looking for lines of the form:
#X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475
#Count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and compute the average of those values and produce 
#an output as shown below. Do not use the sum() function or a variable named sum in your solution.
